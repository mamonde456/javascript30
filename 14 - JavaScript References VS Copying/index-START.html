      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const arr = players;
      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const arr1 = players.slice();
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const arr2 = players.concat();
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const arr3 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      const arr4 = Array.from(players);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const obj = person;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const obj2 = Object.assign({}, person, { local: "ddd" });
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // 객체도 스프레드로 복사할 수 있다.
      const obj3 = { ...person };
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const test = {
        name: "Kim",
        age: 20,
        social: {
          twitter: "@Kim",
          facebook: "Kim.developer",
        },
      };
      // 얕은 복사
      const dev = Object.assign({}, test);
      // 깊은 복사
      const dev1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(test));
